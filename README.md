Test Driven Development and refracting
The whole idea behind Test-Driven Development (TDD) is to create a disciplined and systematic approach to software development that places testing at the forefront of the development process. TDD is based on a simple but powerful cycle often referred to as the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle, and its primary goal is to improve code quality, reliability, and maintainability.
